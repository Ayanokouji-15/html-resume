    <b>Cat Lovers</b> are the kind of people who willingly serve tiny furry dictators in exchange for the occasional purr. They can identify moods based on tail flicks, own more lint rollers than socks, and somehow enjoy being ignored by the creature they love most. They're experts in nap etiquette, fluent in baby talk, and believe every cardboard box is a gift from the universe.

<p>
    <b>Dog lovers</b> on the other hand, are the kind of people who talk to their pets like they're toddlers, refer to themselves as "mom" or "dad," and believe o outfit is complete without a little fur. They celebrate tail wags like Nobel Prizes, know every bark has a meaning, and will gladly cancel plans just to stay home with their four-legged best friend. Yes, they've cried at a reunion video. Probably today.
